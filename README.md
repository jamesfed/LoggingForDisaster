<summary>Why do I need to log?</summary>

# Why do I need to log?
To answer questions, such as:
* Sophos detected a malicious program on a computer - where did it come from?
* Based on the data in a threat intel report have we been impacted?
* What files have been copied to the Internet from a computer?

But also...
* To identify the root cause of an incident (non-security related!).
* To comply with regulations.
* Generally a 'good idea'.

## Beware - rabbit hole ahead!
* Deception and honeypots.
* Log review.

<summary>What should I log?</summary>

# What should I log?

## Data that'll be useful in forensic analysis
* New application process.
* DNS requests.
* URL requests.
* New/modified file and registry keys.
* Loading of drivers.
* Reading specific file types (e.g. .docx/.pdf/.xlsx).
* Script/command line interface use.

## Data that'll be useful in threat hunting

* URLs.
* File hashes (MD5/SHA1/SHA256).
* File names and paths.
* IP addresses.
* Domains.

## Abnormal events
* AppLocker blocked the execution of a new application.
* Excessive requests to unauthorised web or file sharing services.
* Break glass account used... careful about to hit that rabbit hole.

<summary>How do I capture logs?</summary>

# How do I capture logs?

## Windows
* From Windows Event Logs, [NXLog CE](https://nxlog.co/products/nxlog-community-edition), 

## Linux


## Network appliances


## Cloud Services
* API connectors.

<summary>Where should those logs go?</summary>

# Where should those logs go?
* Local storage
* Centralised storage
* Consider 'cloud' options

## Consider: authentication and encryption
* Network appliances don't always support both/either.
* May need to use some form of logging 'proxy'.
* If running a 'cloud' logging service the importance is even greater.
* Don't underestimate a threat actors resourcefulness, easy to generate sufficient logs to overwhelm a system.

## If storing on-premises consider
* Network level access controls to the log system.
* Authentication to the log system.
* Dependencies on systems that may be offline in an incident (compute, storage, networking, authentication).

## A recommendation for on-premises
* Place the server(s) in a dedicated 'logging' network.
* Restrict access into that network with a network firewall, broadly allow connections to the ports that logging agents talk to, restrict by source network/IP/user/device access to the management interface.
* Dedicated physical server or servers (3 smaller nodes in a cluster is better than 1 single node by itself).
* Strong authentication (phishing resistant) as the 'day to day' access, with a fallback to local authentication with a strong (long) passphrase.

# Volume vs value
* Firewall traffic logs - VERY high volume, low relative value
* DNS logs - high volume, low-medium relative value
  * But.... DNS is encrypted now

# Iâ€™m sold! What do I need to do?

## But also don't forget to:

* Do maintenance! Don't let that logging system run out of disk space!
* Check all log sources are sending logs.
* Routine check that the times of systems are in sync.

## If you have the spare time:

* Conduct audit log reviews.
  * Perform some 'malicious' activities and then check that the logs you expect were captured.
    * [There is software that can help with this](https://validato.io/).
  * Use threat intel reports
